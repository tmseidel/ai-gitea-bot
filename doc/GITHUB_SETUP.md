# GitHub Setup

This guide walks you through preparing your GitHub account or GitHub Enterprise instance to work with the AI Code Review Bot.

## 1. Create the Bot User (Recommended)

For production use, create a dedicated GitHub user account for the bot. This keeps bot activity separate from human users and allows fine-grained access control.

### For github.com

1. Create a new GitHub account for the bot (e.g., `ai-code-reviewer`)
2. Use a dedicated email address for the bot account
3. Complete account setup and email verification

### For GitHub Enterprise

1. As an admin, create a new user account (e.g., `ai_bot`)
2. Or request an admin to create a service account for the bot

> **Alternative:** You can use a personal account for testing, but a dedicated bot account is recommended for production.

## 2. Add the Bot to Organizations and Repositories

The bot needs read/write access to repositories where it should perform code reviews.

### Option A: Organization Member

1. Navigate to your organization's **People** tab
2. Click **Invite member**
3. Search for the bot's username and add it
4. Assign the appropriate role:
   - **Member** with repository-level access, or
   - Create a team with write access to specific repositories

### Option B: Repository Collaborator

1. Navigate to the repository's **Settings → Collaborators**
2. Click **Add people**
3. Search for the bot's username
4. Select **Write** access level

The bot needs at minimum:
- **Read** access to pull requests and code
- **Write** access to issues/comments (for posting reviews and reactions)
- **Write** access to pull requests (for posting reviews)

## 3. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

The bot authenticates against the GitHub API using a Personal Access Token.

### Classic Token (Simpler)

1. Log in as the bot user
2. Go to **Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)**
3. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
4. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `ai-code-review-bot`)
5. Select the following **scopes**:
   - ✅ `repo` — Full control of private repositories
   - ✅ `write:discussion` — Write access to discussions (optional)
6. Click **Generate token**
7. **Copy the token immediately** — it will not be shown again

### Fine-Grained Token (More Secure)

1. Log in as the bot user
2. Go to **Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens**
3. Click **Generate new token**
4. Configure:
   - **Token name:** `ai-code-review-bot`
   - **Expiration:** Set an appropriate expiration
   - **Repository access:** Select specific repositories or "All repositories"
5. Under **Permissions**, set:
   - **Repository permissions:**
     - ✅ `Contents`: Read and write
     - ✅ `Issues`: Read and write
     - ✅ `Pull requests`: Read and write
     - ✅ `Metadata`: Read-only (required)
6. Click **Generate token**
7. **Copy the token immediately** — it will not be shown again

You'll enter this token when creating a **Git Integration** in the bot's web UI.

## 4. Configure Webhooks

Webhooks tell GitHub to notify the bot when pull request events occur. Each bot has a unique webhook URL.

### Getting the Webhook URL

1. In the bot's web UI, go to **Bots**
2. Click on your bot (or create one if you haven't)
3. The **Webhook URL** is displayed at the top of the edit form
4. Copy this URL (e.g., `http://your-bot-server:8080/api/github-webhook/abc123-def456-...`)

### Repository-Level Webhook

1. In the repository, go to **Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook**
2. Configure:
   - **Payload URL:** Paste the bot's webhook URL
   - **Content type:** `application/json`
   - **Secret:** (leave empty — authentication is via the URL path)
3. Under **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**, select **Let me select individual events**, then enable:
   - ✅ **Pull requests**
   - ✅ **Pull request reviews**
   - ✅ **Pull request review comments**
   - ✅ **Issue comments**
   - ✅ **Issues** (only if using the agent feature)
4. Ensure **Active** is checked
5. Click **Add webhook**

### Organization-Level Webhook

To cover all repositories in an organization at once:

1. Go to the organization's **Settings → Webhooks**
2. Click **Add webhook**
3. Follow the same configuration as above

> **Note:** Organization webhooks require admin permissions.

### Multiple Bots

You can create multiple bots with different configurations (different AI providers, different prompts) and point different repositories or organizations to different bot webhook URLs.

## 5. Configure the Bot

In the bot's web UI:

1. **Create a Git Integration:**
   - Go to **Git Integrations → New Integration**
   - Select **GitHub** as the provider type
   - Enter your GitHub URL:
     - For github.com: `https://github.com`
     - For GitHub Enterprise: `https://github.yourdomain.com`
   - Enter the Personal Access Token you created above
   - Click **Save**

2. **Create or Edit a Bot:**
   - Set the **Username** to match the bot's GitHub username (e.g., `ai-code-reviewer`)
   - This is used to detect and ignore the bot's own actions
   - The mention alias is derived as `@ai-code-reviewer`

## GitHub Enterprise Server

For GitHub Enterprise Server installations:

### URL Configuration

Enter your GitHub Enterprise URL in the Git Integration form:

```
https://github.yourdomain.com
```

The bot automatically converts this to the API URL (`https://github.yourdomain.com/api/v3`).

### Self-Signed Certificates

If your GitHub Enterprise uses self-signed certificates, you may need to configure the JVM to trust them. See your deployment documentation for details.

### Rate Limits

GitHub Enterprise has rate limits that may differ from github.com. Monitor your API usage if you have many repositories or high PR volume.

## Verification

After setup, create a test pull request. The bot should:

1. Automatically post an AI-generated code review
2. Respond when mentioned in PR comments (e.g., `@ai-code-reviewer explain this`)
3. Respond to inline review comments mentioning the bot
4. React with 👀 to acknowledge commands

Check the bot's application logs for troubleshooting if reviews don't appear.

## Troubleshooting

### "Bad credentials" Error

- Ensure the Personal Access Token is correct and not expired
- Verify the token has the required permissions/scopes
- For fine-grained tokens, ensure the token has access to the specific repository

### "Not Found" Error

- Ensure the bot user has access to the repository
- Check that the repository URL is correct
- Verify organization membership if using an org-level webhook

### Webhook Not Received

- Check the webhook delivery logs in GitHub (Settings → Webhooks → Recent Deliveries)
- Ensure the bot server is accessible from GitHub's servers
- For github.com, ensure your server allows incoming connections from GitHub's IP ranges

### Reviews Not Posted

- Check the bot's application logs for error messages
- Verify the AI integration is configured correctly
- Ensure the bot is enabled in the bot settings
